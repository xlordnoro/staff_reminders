# staff_reminders
Designed to make a more seamless and less annoying method of informing staff.

January 29, 2024 - v1.0 - Added the initial commit to the repo. Unless things need massive changes, I likely won't be updating the repo beyond this since it already has the required features needed.

January 30, 2024 - v1.0.1 - I didn't realize that the timer code had reverted to the previous version instead of minutes and seconds.
